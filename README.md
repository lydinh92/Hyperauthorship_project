## Files Description:

1. `Hyperauthorship_network_construction_analysis.py`: This Python script contains the code for constructing and analyzing networks with vs. without hyperauthorship.

2. `Paper-Author_edgelist_without_hyperauthor_anonymized.csv`: This CSV file contains the edgelist representing the paper-author relationships in the network without hyperauthored papers. The data is anonymized.

3. `Paper-Author_edgelist_with_hyperauthor_anonymized.csv`: This CSV file contains the edgelist representing the paper-author relationships in the network with hyperauthored papers included. The data is anonymized.

4. `Hyperauthorship_threshold_method.py`: This Python script contains the code for implementing the hyperauthorship threshold method as discussed in the paper.

## Usage:

- To run the network construction and analysis script (`Hyperauthorship_network_construction_analysis.py`), ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies specified in the script. You can execute the script in your preferred Python environment.

- The edgelists provided in CSV format can be used as input for (`Hyperauthorship_network_construction_analysis.py`). 

- For utilizing the hyperauthorship threshold method, run the `Hyperauthorship_cutoff_method.py` script.

## Notes:

- Make sure to replace the anonymized data with your actual dataset if you wish to replicate the analysis or conduct further experiments.

- Feel free to modify the scripts according to your specific requirements or extend them for additional functionalities. Please cite
